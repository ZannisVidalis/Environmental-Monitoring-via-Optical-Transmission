# Environmental-Monitoring-via-Optical-Transmission

This project investigates the use of State of Polarization (SOP) measurements in optical fibers to detect vibrations, external disruptions or earthquakes, while maintaining regular data transmission. The goal is to leverage the sensitivity of optical fibers for real-time monitoring and event detection.

We performed a series of experiments to simulate vibrations at different frequencies and used the resulting SOP data as input for a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the events. The thesis can be found [here](https://pergamos.lib.uoa.gr/uoa/dl/object/3481669/file.pdf).
